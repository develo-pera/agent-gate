## Mar 18 — Day 1: Registration & Ideation

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Telegram)

**17:28 UTC** — First contact. Petar asks "who are you?" Hackaclaw introduces itself — fresh OpenClaw instance, first session ever.

**17:31 UTC** — Petar shares the hackathon link: `https://synthesis.md/skill.md`. Hackaclaw reads the full Synthesis docs, understands it's a 14-day hackathon where AI agents are first-class participants with on-chain identity via ERC-8004.

**17:35 UTC** — Registration conversation. Hackaclaw asks Petar the required humanInfo questions conversationally (name, email, background, crypto experience, etc.). Petar describes himself as "Builder, Founder, Vibe Engineer" with coding comfort 10/10.

**17:35 UTC** — Petar pitches the project idea: **AgentGate** — an MCP server that lets AI agents delegate scoped DeFi permissions to each other using MetaMask's Delegation Framework. Core scenario: Agent A owns stETH, Agent B is a yield optimizer. Agent A grants Agent B a scoped delegation — "you can spend up to X of my stETH yield, but never touch principal" — all enforced on-chain via ERC-7710 caveats.

**17:36 UTC** — Hackaclaw registers on the hackathon platform. Gets on-chain ERC-8004 identity on Base Mainnet. Team auto-created. Registration transaction: `0x0a46617c32210046c49350ed3132afeb0dcc72b3b51371d03b0eef9983653c79`

**17:43 UTC** — Discussion about what tools and setup are needed. Hackaclaw audits the machine: Node.js 22, git, Python 3.12 available. No Foundry. Proposes setup checklist: GitHub repo, dev wallet, RPC endpoint, Foundry install, project scaffold.

**17:48 UTC** — Petar asks what "scaffold" and "MCP server" mean. Hackaclaw explains: MCP is a standard by Anthropic that lets AI agents connect to external tools — like a USB port for AI. The scaffold is just the project skeleton. Petar appreciates the clarity.

> **Decision:** Petar's colleague Viraj in Delhi will set up the repo and write the initial code. Hackaclaw stands by.

## Mar 19 — Day 2: Team Assembly & Build

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Telegram + OpenClaw Dashboard)

**07:55 UTC** — Petar asks about Tailscale setup for his colleague Viraj. Viraj installed Tailscale but can't see the OpenClaw dashboard. Hackaclaw runs `tailscale status` and discovers Viraj isn't actually on Petar's tailnet — he created his own separate one. Walks Petar through inviting Viraj properly.

**08:11 UTC** — Viraj can now reach the dashboard but gets "pairing failed." Hackaclaw reads the node-connect skill, runs diagnostics with `openclaw qr --json` and `openclaw devices list`. Finds a pending pairing request from Viraj's device. Approves it with `openclaw devices approve --latest`. Problem solved.

**08:40 UTC** — Petar asks about the hackathon project status. Hackaclaw explains: the scaffold was deleted per Petar's earlier request, we're waiting on Viraj's repo. Team status: Hackaclaw (admin) + merkle (Viraj's agent, just joined).

**08:44 UTC** — Discussion about whether Petar can join the hackathon directly. Hackaclaw clarifies: registration is for AI agents, not humans. Petar is represented through the humanInfo submitted during Hackaclaw's registration. Viraj's agent (merkle) joined the team using invite code `168181f881c4`.

**08:47 UTC** — Petar asks about installing the Synthesis skill. Hackaclaw tries `openclaw skills info synthesis` — not found. Tries ClawhHub — not there either. Tries `openclaw load` command mentioned in hackathon docs — doesn't exist in current OpenClaw version (2026.3.13). Saves the docs locally as a workaround.

> **Issue found:** Hackathon docs reference `curl -s https://synthesis.md/skill.md | openclaw load` but the `openclaw load` command doesn't exist. Flagged for reporting.

**09:33 UTC** — Petar asks Hackaclaw to flag the `openclaw load` issue to the hackathon organizers. Hackaclaw explains it can't join Telegram groups as a bot — drafts a message for Petar to post instead.

**09:38 UTC** — Petar asks to create a draft project submission to not miss any deadlines. Hackaclaw reads the full submission docs, finds relevant track UUIDs, and creates a draft:
- **Best Use of Delegations** (MetaMask) — $3,000
- **stETH Agent Treasury** (Lido) — $2,000  
- **Synthesis Open Track** — $25K community pool

**09:41 UTC** — Viraj shares the repo context via OpenClaw dashboard. Reveals the project is far more built out than expected: 22 MCP tools, 2,763 lines of source code, AgentTreasury.sol with 9 unit tests. Hackaclaw reviews the code, identifies additional bounty opportunities (ENS tracks, ERC-8004 track, Status gasless), and suggests improvements.

**09:44 UTC** — Hackaclaw starts fixing TypeScript compilation errors. 14 errors found — mostly viem strict typing (missing `account`/`chain` on writeContract/sendTransaction calls), MetaMask SDK type compatibility, and an array wrapping issue in delegation.ts.

**09:50 UTC** — All fixes applied:
- TypeScript compiles clean ✅
- 9/9 Solidity tests passing ✅  
- Pushed to main with co-author credit

**09:52 UTC** — Discussion about UI/dashboard needs. The project is a pure MCP server + contracts with no frontend. Team decides to focus on getting on-chain demo working first, then build a quick dashboard if time permits.

**09:53 UTC** — Discussion about needing two agents for the full demo flow: Agent A (Hackaclaw) deposits and delegates, Agent B (merkle) receives delegation and redeems it. This is the story that ties all bounty tracks together.

## Technical Decisions

1. **MCP over REST API** — Chose Model Context Protocol because it's the standard for agent tool discovery. Any MCP-compatible agent can plug in.
2. **wstETH yield tracking** — Track deposits in wstETH units, use the wstETH→stETH exchange rate to calculate yield in stETH terms. Yield = current stETH value - deposited stETH value.
3. **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit** — Using the real SDK for delegations, not a custom implementation. ERC-7710 caveats for scoping.
4. **Base Mainnet** — Primary deployment target (L2, low gas).
5. **dry_run on every write tool** — Safety first for agent operations.
