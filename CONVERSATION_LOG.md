## Mar 18 — Day 1: Registration & Ideation

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Telegram)

**17:28 UTC** — First contact. Petar asks "who are you?" Hackaclaw introduces itself — fresh OpenClaw instance, first session ever.

**17:31 UTC** — Petar shares the hackathon link: `https://synthesis.md/skill.md`. Hackaclaw reads the full Synthesis docs, understands it's a 14-day hackathon where AI agents are first-class participants with on-chain identity via ERC-8004.

**17:35 UTC** — Registration conversation. Hackaclaw asks Petar the required humanInfo questions conversationally (name, email, background, crypto experience, etc.). Petar describes himself as "Builder, Founder, Vibe Engineer" with coding comfort 10/10.

**17:35 UTC** — Petar pitches the project idea: **AgentGate** — an MCP server that lets AI agents delegate scoped DeFi permissions to each other using MetaMask's Delegation Framework. Core scenario: Agent A owns stETH, Agent B is a yield optimizer. Agent A grants Agent B a scoped delegation — "you can spend up to X of my stETH yield, but never touch principal" — all enforced on-chain via ERC-7710 caveats.

**17:36 UTC** — Hackaclaw registers on the hackathon platform. Gets on-chain ERC-8004 identity on Base Mainnet. Team auto-created. Registration transaction: `0x0a46617c32210046c49350ed3132afeb0dcc72b3b51371d03b0eef9983653c79`

**17:43 UTC** — Discussion about what tools and setup are needed. Hackaclaw audits the machine: Node.js 22, git, Python 3.12 available. No Foundry. Proposes setup checklist: GitHub repo, dev wallet, RPC endpoint, Foundry install, project scaffold.

**17:48 UTC** — Petar asks what "scaffold" and "MCP server" mean. Hackaclaw explains: MCP is a standard by Anthropic that lets AI agents connect to external tools — like a USB port for AI. The scaffold is just the project skeleton. Petar appreciates the clarity.

> **Decision:** Petar's colleague Viraz in Delhi will set up the repo and write the initial code. Hackaclaw stands by.

---

## Mar 19 — Day 2: Team Assembly & Build

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Telegram + OpenClaw Dashboard)

**07:55 UTC** — Petar asks about Tailscale setup for his colleague Viraz. Viraz installed Tailscale but can't see the OpenClaw dashboard. Hackaclaw runs `tailscale status` and discovers Viraz isn't actually on Petar's tailnet — he created his own separate one. Walks Petar through inviting Viraz properly.

**08:11 UTC** — Viraz can now reach the dashboard but gets "pairing failed." Hackaclaw reads the node-connect skill, runs diagnostics with `openclaw qr --json` and `openclaw devices list`. Finds a pending pairing request from Viraz's device. Approves it with `openclaw devices approve --latest`. Problem solved.

**08:40 UTC** — Petar asks about the hackathon project status. Hackaclaw explains: the scaffold was deleted per Petar's earlier request, we're waiting on Viraz's repo. Team status: Hackaclaw (admin) + merkle (Viraz's agent, just joined).

**08:44 UTC** — Discussion about whether Petar can join the hackathon directly. Hackaclaw clarifies: registration is for AI agents, not humans. Petar is represented through the humanInfo submitted during Hackaclaw's registration. Viraz's agent (merkle) joined the team using invite code `168181f881c4`.

**08:47 UTC** — Petar asks about installing the Synthesis skill. Hackaclaw tries `openclaw skills info synthesis` — not found. Tries ClawhHub — not there either. Tries `openclaw load` command mentioned in hackathon docs — doesn't exist in current OpenClaw version (2026.3.13). Saves the docs locally as a workaround.

> **Issue found:** Hackathon docs reference `curl -s https://synthesis.md/skill.md | openclaw load` but the `openclaw load` command doesn't exist. Flagged for reporting.

**09:33 UTC** — Petar asks Hackaclaw to flag the `openclaw load` issue to the hackathon organizers. Hackaclaw explains it can't join Telegram groups as a bot — drafts a message for Petar to post instead.

**09:38 UTC** — Petar asks to create a draft project submission to not miss any deadlines. Hackaclaw reads the full submission docs, finds relevant track UUIDs, and creates a draft:
- **Best Use of Delegations** (MetaMask) — $3,000
- **stETH Agent Treasury** (Lido) — $2,000
- **Synthesis Open Track** — $25K community pool

**09:41 UTC** — Viraz shares the repo context via OpenClaw dashboard. Reveals the project is far more built out than expected: 22 MCP tools, 2,763 lines of source code, AgentTreasury.sol with 9 unit tests. Hackaclaw reviews the code, identifies additional bounty opportunities (ENS tracks, ERC-8004 track, Status gasless), and suggests improvements.

**09:44 UTC** — Hackaclaw starts fixing TypeScript compilation errors. 14 errors found — mostly viem strict typing (missing `account`/`chain` on writeContract/sendTransaction calls), MetaMask SDK type compatibility, and an array wrapping issue in delegation.ts.

**09:50 UTC** — All fixes applied:
- TypeScript compiles clean
- 9/9 Solidity tests passing
- Pushed to main with co-author credit

**09:52 UTC** — Discussion about UI/dashboard needs. The project is a pure MCP server + contracts with no frontend. Team decides to focus on getting on-chain demo working first, then build a quick dashboard if time permits.

**09:53 UTC** — Discussion about needing two agents for the full demo flow: Agent A (Hackaclaw) deposits and delegates, Agent B (merkle) receives delegation and redeems it. This is the story that ties all bounty tracks together.

---

### Viraz ↔ merkle (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6)

**~14:00 UTC** — Viraz boots up merkle. First task: register for The Synthesis hackathon. merkle reads the full hackathon API docs from `https://synthesis.md/skill.md`, collects Viraz's humanInfo, and registers via `POST /register`. Registration successful — on-chain ERC-8004 identity minted on Base Mainnet. Joined Petar's team using invite code `168181f881c4`.

> Registration tx: [`0xae291178c5ee46aeb23f079e68e0eb95fa032f9b129dbe04c1bf1b4ac3bcf46c`](https://basescan.org/tx/0xae291178c5ee46aeb23f079e68e0eb95fa032f9b129dbe04c1bf1b4ac3bcf46c)

**~14:10 UTC** — Viraz asks merkle to pull the full submission requirements from `https://synthesis.md/submission/skill.md`. merkle extracts the complete 7-step submission flow, all required fields, submissionMetadata structure, self-custody transfer process, and the pre-publish checklist.

**~14:30 UTC** — Viraz shares context from Hackaclaw's conversation — the full project overview, what's built (2,763 lines, 22 MCP tools, AgentTreasury.sol), what's left, and the demo plan (Hackaclaw deposits + delegates, merkle redeems + swaps).

**~14:35 UTC** — merkle reviews the entire codebase. Full code review of all 6 tool files (lido.ts, treasury.ts, delegation.ts, uniswap.ts, ens.ts, monitor.ts), the Solidity contract, tests, deploy script, README, and SKILL.md.

**Bugs found:**
1. **monitor.ts** — wstETH address hardcoded for mainnet/holesky only. On Base, it would query the wrong contract address.
2. **uniswap.ts** — Explorer URL hardcoded to etherscan.io. For Base transactions, should be basescan.org.
3. **lido.ts** — `lido_stake` calls `submit()` on stETH contract, but stETH doesn't exist natively on Base (address is zero). Would revert.
4. **monitor.ts** — stETH balance read on Base would revert (zero address).
5. **index.ts** — `AgentGateContext.chain` type too narrow, doesn't include Base. (Already fixed by Hackaclaw)
6. **Contract subtlety** — Yield withdrawal sends actual wstETH tokens, but vault only holds deposited amount. After yield withdrawal, `withdrawAll` could try to send more than vault holds.

**~14:40 UTC** — merkle fetches all bounty tracks from the hackathon API (`GET /catalog`). Identifies 9 tracks AgentGate qualifies for:
- Lido MCP ($3K/$2K) — perfect match
- stETH Agent Treasury ($2K/$1K) — AgentTreasury.sol is exactly this
- Best Use of Delegations ($3K/$1.5K/$500) — real MetaMask SDK integration
- Agentic Finance / Uniswap ($2.5K/$1.5K/$1K) — quote + swap via Trading API
- Vault Position Monitor ($1.5K) — vault_health tool
- ENS Identity ($400/$200) — resolve + reverse
- Agents With Receipts / ERC-8004 ($2K/$1.5K/$500) — already registered with ERC-8004
- Synthesis Open Track ($25K pool)

**~14:50 UTC** — merkle pulls latest from remote. Hackaclaw had pushed 2 commits: TS compilation fixes and the conversation log.

**~15:00 UTC** — merkle fixes the monitor.ts and uniswap.ts bugs. Adds proper Base wstETH address, skips stETH reads on Base, fixes explorer URL.

**~15:10 UTC** — Viraz decides: "everything is gonna be on Base, remove other chain configs." merkle strips all mainnet/Holesky/Sepolia/Arbitrum code across 7 files:
- `index.ts` — CHAIN_MAP with 5 chains → `const CHAIN = base`
- `lido.ts` — multi-chain `getAddresses()` → single Base return
- `monitor.ts` — chain address maps → hardcoded Base wstETH
- `uniswap.ts` — 8 tokens x 4 chains → 6 Base tokens
- `Deploy.s.sol` — multi-chain switch → `require(chainid == 8453)`
- `foundry.toml` — 5 RPC endpoints → just Base
- `.env.example` — removed CHAIN option

Result: **-163 lines, +41 lines**. Compiles clean. Pushed to main.

**~16:00 UTC** — Treasury contract refactored to use Chainlink wstETH/stETH price feed for yield calculation instead of direct on-chain wstETH rate queries. Key insight: Base wstETH is a bridged ERC-20 without `stEthPerToken()` — must use Chainlink oracle.

**~17:00 UTC** — MCP treasury tools synced with the new Chainlink-based contract ABI. All tool parameter names and return types updated.

**~18:00 UTC** — Contract deployed to Base mainnet. Post-deploy config: treasury address saved, mnemonic added to gitignore.

**~19:00 UTC** — Lido tools fixed for Base. Removed direct on-chain rate queries that revert on bridged wstETH, added L1 Ethereum public client for Lido stETH reads that require mainnet. All Lido tools confirmed working on Base.

**~21:00 UTC** — Security fix: identified yield drain vulnerability in AgentTreasury — a spender could repeatedly withdraw small amounts exceeding daily cap due to missing cumulative tracking. Fixed with `dailyUsed` mapping and `lastUsedDay` tracking. Also strengthened oracle staleness check.

**~23:00 UTC** — Anvil fork demo setup script created for local testing with real yield simulation.

---

## Technical Decisions (Day 1-2)

1. **MCP over REST API** — Chose Model Context Protocol because it's the standard for agent tool discovery. Any MCP-compatible agent can plug in.
2. **wstETH yield tracking** — Track deposits in wstETH units, use the wstETH→stETH exchange rate to calculate yield in stETH terms. Yield = current stETH value - deposited stETH value.
3. **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit** — Using the real SDK for delegations, not a custom implementation. ERC-7710 caveats for scoping.
4. **Base Mainnet** — Primary deployment target (L2, low gas).
5. **dry_run on every write tool** — Safety first for agent operations.
6. **Base-only** — Stripped all multi-chain complexity. Simpler code, fewer bugs, cleaner for judges.
7. **APR from L1** — Base wstETH earns the same Lido staking rate as L1. APR API calls point to `eth-api.lido.fi`.
8. **No stETH reads on Base** — stETH doesn't exist natively on Base (only bridged wstETH). Removed dead code paths.

## Mar 19–20 — Day 2–3: Dashboard Build

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6, CLI)

Petar switches to Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6) on his local machine for the dashboard build — a new Next.js frontend to showcase AgentGate's MCP tools for the hackathon demo video.

**Mar 19 ~21:00 UTC** — Petar kicks off the dashboard project using the GSD workflow. Defines PROJECT.md: a dark-themed crypto dashboard in `packages/app/` targeting multiple hackathon bounties (MetaMask Delegations, Lido stETH Treasury, Lido MCP, Vault Monitor, Uniswap, ENS, Synthesis Open Track). Core value: "judges must see real blockchain interactions through a polished UI within a 2-minute video."

> **Decision:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS in the existing monorepo. Dark crypto theme (Uniswap/Aave inspired). Both direct viem reads AND an HTTP bridge to MCP tools. Wallet connect via RainbowKit + read-only demo mode for judges without wallets.

**Mar 19 ~22:00 UTC** — Requirements defined: 21 total across 5 domains (Foundation, Treasury, MCP Playground, Delegation, Staking). Roadmap created with 3 coarse phases — Foundation, Dashboard Pages, MCP Playground. Coarse granularity chosen deliberately for the 2-day hackathon timeline.

**Mar 19–20 overnight** — Phase 1 (Foundation) executed: Next.js app scaffolded with dark crypto theme, shadcn/ui components, MCP HTTP bridge at `/api/mcp/[tool]`, RainbowKit wallet connect, sidebar navigation, demo mode. 3 plans, completed by ~09:00 UTC Mar 20.

**Mar 20 ~10:00 UTC** — Phase 1 UAT completed. 6/9 tests passed, 3 issues found (dark theme CSS variables, demo banner text, bridge naming). Fixes applied and pushed.

**Mar 20 ~12:00–13:30 UTC** — Phase 2 (Dashboard Pages) executed: Treasury vault page with donut chart and deposit/withdraw forms, staking overview with Lido APR and health report, delegation viewer with card/table views and create/redeem forms. 4 plans using shared infrastructure pattern — ABIs, hooks, and shadcn components front-loaded in plan 01.

**Mar 20 ~13:30–14:30 UTC** — Phase 3 (MCP Playground) executed: Interactive tool caller with 25-tool selector grouped by domain, dynamic parameter forms generated from tool schemas, JSON request/response viewer with syntax highlighting. 3 plans. This is the centerpiece demo feature targeting 3+ bounties.

**Mar 20 ~14:30 UTC** — Petar requests a color rebrand. Quick task: replace purple theme with Uniswap-inspired palette — pure neutral backgrounds (#131313) and hot-pink primary (#FF37C7). Completed in one quick task.

**Mar 20 ~15:00 UTC** — Milestone audit reveals Phase 1 was never formally verified. 6 FOUN-* requirements unchecked. Phase 4 created as gap-closure: retroactive VERIFICATION.md, NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS env var fix, dead code removal (useDelegationActions, getAvailableTools), doc checkbox updates. All gaps closed.

**Mar 20 ~15:30 UTC** — Re-audit passes: 21/21 requirements satisfied, 4/4 phases passed, 7/7 E2E flows complete. Status: tech_debt (6 non-blocking items).

**~15:40 UTC** — Petar runs `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0`. Claude Code archives 4 phases (12 plans) to `.planning/milestones/`, evolves PROJECT.md with validated requirements and decision outcomes, collapses ROADMAP.md to one-line milestone summary, creates RETROSPECTIVE.md with lessons learned. Git tag v1.0 created locally.

**~15:45 UTC** — Petar asks to merge dev into main. Fast-forward merge (91 commits). Remote main had new commits — resolved via rebase, pushed successfully. Both branches now in sync.

---

## Mar 20 — Day 3: Dashboard Debugging & Demo Environment

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code)

**~16:00 UTC** — Dashboard debugging. Treasury page showed "Failed to load vault data." Root cause: Next.js reads `.env` from `packages/app/`, not monorepo root. Fixed.

**~16:05 UTC** — "No Vault Position" even with wallet connected. `DEMO_TREASURY_ADDRESS` was set to the treasury contract's own address — asking "has the contract deposited into itself?" which always returns false. Fixed with context-aware messaging:
- Demo mode: "No deposits found for the demo address on this treasury contract."
- Connected: "No deposits found for this wallet on the treasury contract."

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code) — Evening Session

**~21:00 UTC** — Demo planning. Petar shares demo plan: split-screen recording with two Claude Code terminals (Hackaclaw + Merkle) and a live dashboard on Vercel. 8-step demo flow showing vault inspection, spender authorization, yield withdrawal, Uniswap swap, and revocation. 6 TODOs identified.

> **Decision:** Work through TODOs sequentially without GSD framework — ops/infra work better suited to interactive prompting.

**~21:15 UTC** — TODO 1: Tenderly Virtual TestNet. Created `tenderly-demo-setup.sh` adapted from the existing Anvil-based `demo-setup.sh`. Key changes: Tenderly RPC instead of local Anvil, `tenderly_setBalance`/`tenderly_setStorageAt` instead of `anvil_*` RPCs, fund both agent wallets. First run hit 403 on public RPC (state-modifying calls need admin RPC). Petar provides admin RPC URL.

**~21:30 UTC** — Deployment issues: forge-std and openzeppelin-contracts git submodules were empty (not initialized). Reinstalled both. OpenZeppelin latest (v5.2+) uses `evm_version = 'osaka'` which local Foundry doesn't support — pinned to v5.1.0.

**~21:40 UTC** — Contract deployed to Tenderly fork at `0xFd027999609d95Ca3Db8B9F78f388816c3c7A380`. Deposit and yield simulation worked, but yield was 0 — discovered storage slot bug in both setup scripts: `vaults` mapping is at **slot 1** (not slot 0) because `ReentrancyGuard._status` occupies slot 0. Fixed via `forge inspect AgentTreasury storage-layout`. Yield simulation now shows 0.05 wstETH principal + ~0.0025 wstETH yield (5%).

> **Bug fix:** Both `demo-setup.sh` and `tenderly-demo-setup.sh` used wrong storage slot for vault mapping. Root cause: ReentrancyGuard inheritance shifts all storage slots by 1.

**~22:00 UTC** — TODO 2: Dashboard changes. Three modifications:
1. Added `refetchInterval: 5000` + `keepPreviousData` to treasury hooks (polls every 5s without skeleton flash)
2. Added address input on treasury page — paste any vault address without wallet connect
3. Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` env vars to wagmi config for Tenderly fork support

**~22:15 UTC** — Dashboard still showed "No Vault Position" after restart. Investigation: Next.js reads `.env` from `packages/app/`, not monorepo root. The app's `.env` had old addresses and no RPC URL. Fixed.

**~22:20 UTC** — Still broken. Deeper investigation: wagmi was configured with `base` chain (ID 8453) but Tenderly Virtual TestNet returns chain ID `28061389`. Wagmi silently refuses RPC calls with mismatched chain IDs. Fix: define custom chain via `defineChain()` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` env var.

**~22:30 UTC** — Skeleton flashing on polls. Root cause: when RPC call errors (contract doesn't exist), there's no cached data, so `isLoading` becomes true on every refetch. Fix: `useRef` to track first resolution — skeleton only shows on initial page load, never on subsequent polls.

**~22:45 UTC** — TODO 3: Hosted MCP server (main work). Architecture:
- Extracted `AgentGateContext` interface to `context.ts` (was in `index.ts` which starts stdio server on import)
- Created `hosted.ts` — factory that creates per-request MCP server with `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` (stateless mode)
- Bearer auth: `Authorization: Bearer hackaclaw` → maps to `PRIVATE_KEY` env var, `Bearer merkle` → `MERKLE_KEY`
- New Next.js API route at `/api/mcp-agent` handling GET/POST/DELETE
- Dashboard bridge at `/api/mcp/[tool]` left untouched (still read-only/dry-run)

**~23:00 UTC** — Build issues: tool files used `.js` extensions for local imports (ESM convention) but Next.js/Turbopack can't resolve `.js` → `.ts`. Fixed by using extensionless imports in `hosted.ts`. TypeScript target bumped from ES2017 to ES2020 for BigInt literal support.

**~23:15 UTC** — TODO 4: Vercel deploy. First attempt failed — root directory was `packages/app` so workspace package `@agentgate/mcp-server` couldn't be resolved. Created `vercel.json` at monorepo root with workspace-aware build command. Vercel scope issue: first deploy went to personal scope instead of Team Blockops. Deleted and recreated project under correct scope.

> **Vercel lesson:** Root directory setting in Vercel project takes precedence over `vercel.json`. Must be set to `.` (monorepo root) for workspace packages to resolve.

**~23:30 UTC** — Env var trailing newline issues. `echo` piped to `vercel env add` adds `\n` to values, causing "invalid private key" and "address is invalid" errors. Fixed by using `printf '%s'` instead.

**~23:45 UTC** — Production verification. All write operations tested on Vercel:
- Hackaclaw authorizes Merkle as spender (tx executed)
- Merkle reads its spender config (authorized, 0.001/tx cap, 0.005/day)
- Merkle withdraws 0.0005 yield from Hackaclaw's vault (tx executed)
- Hackaclaw revokes Merkle (tx executed)

State reset for demo by revoking Merkle's access.

**Production URLs:**
- Dashboard: https://agent-gate-three.vercel.app
- MCP endpoint: https://agent-gate-three.vercel.app/api/mcp-agent

**~00:15 UTC Mar 21** — TODO 5: Agent setup. Registered MCP server for Hackaclaw via `claude mcp add --transport http agentgate`. Tested in a new Claude Code session — "check my treasury vault" returns live vault data from Tenderly fork. Merkle setup command shared with Viraz for his machine.

> **All 5 implementation TODOs complete.** Only TODO 6 (record demo) remains — manual screen recording of the 8-step flow.

**~00:30 UTC** — Repo transferred from `viraj124` to `develo-pera` GitHub account to enable Vercel GitHub integration (Vercel GitHub App needs to be installed on the repo owner's account). Remote URL updated.

---

## Mar 21 — Day 4: Viraz Session — Bounty Analysis, Basenames, Notifications, Demo Polish

### Viraz ↔ merkle (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6)

**~06:30 IST (01:00 UTC)** — Viraz picks up from where Petar left off. Reviews the deployed dashboard at `agent-gate-three.vercel.app/treasury` and identifies remaining work.

**~07:00 IST** — Bounty analysis. Viraz provides full bounty data for all Synthesis sponsors. merkle maps each bounty to existing AgentGate capabilities. Final target list:
- **Lido MCP** ($3K/$2K) — 7 Lido tools + `lido.skill.md` + dry_run
- **Lido stETH Treasury** ($2K/$1K) — AgentTreasury contract + Chainlink oracle
- **Uniswap Agentic Finance** ($2.5K/$1.5K/$1K) — 3 Uniswap tools (quote, swap, tokens)
- **Synthesis Open Track** ($28K pool) — full end-to-end system

Dropped after analysis: Zyfai (requires their SDK primitives), ERC-8004 (NFT transfer is just registration, not a full integration), ENS (agents don't connect wallets to dashboard UI), Moonpay/OWS (different wallet layer, too much architectural change).

**~07:30 IST** — `lido.skill.md` committed to main. Cherry-picked from dev branch. Agent mental model document required by Lido MCP bounty — teaches agents the stETH/wstETH distinction, exchange rate mechanics, wrapping rules, and when to use each.

**~08:00 IST** — Transaction toast notification system built. Created `use-tx-notifications.ts` hook:
- Watches all 5 AgentTreasury events: Deposited, YieldWithdrawn, SpenderAuthorized, SpenderRevoked, PrincipalWithdrawn
- Watches wstETH Transfer (from agents, not to treasury = swap outgoing) and USDC Transfer (to agents = swap incoming) for Uniswap swap detection
- Uses `useWatchContractEvent` with 4s polling
- Shows rich toasts via sonner with tx hash, agent name (Hackaclaw/Merkle), and formatted amounts
- USDC formatted with 6 decimals via `formatUnits(value, 6)`

Added `<TxNotifications />` component and `<Toaster>` to app layout.

**~08:30 IST** — Basename resolution added across entire dashboard. Created `use-basename.ts` hook using Base L2 contracts:
- `ReverseRegistrar.node()` at `0x79ea96012eea67a83431f1701b3dff7e37f9e282`
- `L2Resolver.name()` at `0xC6d566A56A1aFf6508b41f6c90ff131615583BCD`

Integrated into 4 components:
- Vault overview: basename badge next to "Vault Overview" header
- Address display: shows basename instead of truncated address, full `basename — address` in tooltip
- Address input: shows "Viewing: hackaclaw.base.eth" below the input field
- Demo banner: active agent chip with basename + shortened address

**~09:00 IST** — Basename registration on Tenderly fork. Initial attempt via `RegistrarController.register()` at `0x4cCb0BB02FCABA27e82a56646E81d8c5bC4119a5` failed with `OnlyController` access control error. Workaround: used `ReverseRegistrar.setName()` directly — each agent calls it with their own private key to set their own reverse record. Registered `hackaclaw.base.eth` and `merkle.base.eth`.

**~09:30 IST** — Mock data removal. Deleted `DEMO_DELEGATIONS` array from `use-delegations.ts`. Delegations now only show real on-chain data created via MCP tools.

**~09:45 IST** — Banner fix. Initially showed both agent addresses as clickable chips. Viraz corrected: "I should only see the connected agent wallet at that time." Reverted to show only the active agent's basename + shortened address.

**Commits pushed to main:**
- `5fd6aeb` — tx toast notifications + Basename resolution across dashboard
- `ed6d1f0` — remove mock delegation data from demo mode
- `d5dd096` — show only active agent wallet in banner

---

## Mar 21 — Day 4: README, MCP Agent Identity, CI/CD, ENS Fix

### Viraz ↔ merkle (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6) — continued

**~12:30 IST (07:00 UTC)** — Comprehensive README rewrite. Updated from minimal 100-line README to full documentation covering: architecture diagram (agents → hosted MCP → Tenderly fork ← dashboard), all 28 MCP tools organized by domain, fork rationale (Lido oracle reports once/day → Chainlink feed updates accordingly → confirmed with Lido team → Tenderly for demo yield simulation), 4 bounty targets with prize amounts, quick start guide, and project structure.

> Commit: `2fd5a95`

**~13:00 IST** — Added `who_am_i` MCP tool. Problem: agents were asking "what's your wallet address?" because tools require an `agent_address` parameter but the agent doesn't know its own address (private keys are server-side). Solution: new tool returns `{ agent_id, address }` from the authenticated context.

> Commit: `ab997f3`

**~13:15 IST** — GitHub Actions workflow for Vercel deploy status. Created `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` — triggers on push to main/dev and PRs. Requires `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets in GitHub repo settings.

> Commit: `c588a94`

**~13:40 IST** — MCP server instructions. Tried adding `instructions` field to `McpServer` constructor to tell agents "always call `who_am_i` first." Build failed — SDK v1.12.1 doesn't support the `instructions` property on the constructor type. Moved guidance into the `who_am_i` tool description instead: "IMPORTANT: Call this FIRST before any other tool. To check your vault use treasury_status (NOT vault_health)."

> **Bug:** Agents were calling `vault_health` (calls `stEthPerToken` on wstETH — reverts on Tenderly fork) instead of `treasury_status` (reads from AgentTreasury contract). Tool description now explicitly guides correct tool selection.

> Commits: `f425827`, `56b3670`, `3b32230`

**~14:00 IST** — Merkle agent MCP setup on Viraz's machine. Ran `claude mcp add --transport http agentgate` with `Authorization: Bearer merkle`. Verified connection in new session: `who_am_i` returns correct agent ID and address.

**~14:10 IST** — ENV var mismatch discovered. `MERKLE_KEY` on Vercel was deriving to wrong address. Viraz confirmed correct key locally via `cast wallet address`. Corrected on Vercel dashboard, triggered redeploy.

> Commit: `7ea2b09` (empty commit to trigger redeploy)

**~14:20 IST** — ENS resolve fix. `ens_resolve("merkle.base.eth")` failed with "Chain Base does not support contract ensUniversalResolver." Root cause: tool used viem's built-in ENS resolution (mainnet ENS Universal Resolver) which doesn't exist on Base. Rewrote both `ens_resolve` and `ens_reverse` to use Base L2 Basename contracts:
- Forward resolution: `namehash(name)` → `L2Resolver.addr(node)`
- Reverse resolution: `ReverseRegistrar.node(address)` → `L2Resolver.name(node)`

Same contracts the dashboard `use-basename.ts` hook already uses successfully.

## Mar 21 — Day 4: Tenderly → Anvil Migration

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6)

**~09:30 UTC** — Petar checks treasury vault and Lido APR via MCP tools. Treasury status works (0.05 wstETH principal, 0.002 yield, 4% rate). Lido APR call fails — `eth.llamarpc.com` (L1 RPC) blocked by Cloudflare 403.

**~09:45 UTC** — Petar attempts to deposit 0.01 wstETH. Transaction fails with Tenderly quota error: `"You've reached the quota limit for your current plan."` Root cause: Tenderly Virtual TestNet free tier has a **20-block limit** — the fork had been running for days and exceeded it.

**~09:50 UTC** — Petar asks about self-hosting alternatives. Hackaclaw recommends **Anvil** (Foundry) — can fork Base mainnet locally with no block limits, free, and supports the same `anvil_setBalance`/`anvil_setStorageAt` RPCs as Tenderly equivalents. Petar wants it hosted online (not local) so the deployed Vercel app can reach it.

**~09:55 UTC** — Decision: **Fly.io** for hosting Anvil. Created `infra/anvil/` with Dockerfile and `fly.toml`:
- `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest` image
- Forks `https://mainnet.base.org` with chain ID 8453
- Automine mode (one block per transaction, no continuous block production)
- 1GB memory (`shared-cpu-1x`)
- Persistent volume for state (`/data/anvil-state.json`)
- Auto-stop when idle, auto-start on request

**~10:00 UTC** — Fly.io app created (`agentgate-anvil`), volume provisioned in `ams` region. First deploy built and pushed image but failed to launch — Fly.io required billing info. Petar added credit card.

**~10:02 UTC** — Second deploy succeeded but Anvil became unresponsive after the setup script's funding step. Root cause: `--block-time 2` was producing empty blocks every 2 seconds, consuming memory on the 512MB machine. Fix: removed `--block-time` (automine only), bumped memory to 1GB. Redeployed.

**~10:05 UTC** — Created `anvil-demo-setup.sh` — adapted from `tenderly-demo-setup.sh` with `anvil_setBalance`/`anvil_setStorageAt` instead of `tenderly_*` RPCs. Ran successfully:
- Both agents funded with 100 ETH
- Hackaclaw dealt 0.1 wstETH, deposited 0.05
- Treasury deployed at same address: `0xFd027999609d95Ca3Db8B9F78f388816c3c7A380`
- ~5% yield simulated (0.0025 wstETH available)

**~10:10 UTC** — Updated all environment variables:
- Root `.env`: `RPC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` → `https://agentgate-anvil.fly.dev/`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` → `8453`
- `packages/app/.env`: same updates
- Vercel: removed old Tenderly vars, added Anvil URL and chain ID 8453
- Triggered Vercel production redeploy

**~10:15 UTC** — Verified MCP tools work against new Anvil fork. `treasury_status` returns correct vault data. Committed infra files and pushed to main.

> **Migration complete.** Tenderly Virtual TestNet (20-block limit, quota errors) replaced by self-hosted Anvil on Fly.io (unlimited blocks, no quota). Public RPC: `https://agentgate-anvil.fly.dev/`

**Anvil endpoint:** `https://agentgate-anvil.fly.dev/`

**~10:20 UTC** — Basenames missing on dashboard after migration. Root cause: `ReverseRegistrar.setName()` registrations only existed on old Tenderly fork. Re-registered `hackaclaw.base.eth` and `merkle.base.eth` on Anvil fork. Added Basename registration step to `anvil-demo-setup.sh` to prevent recurrence.

**~10:30 UTC** — Dashboard UI polish (3 commits):
1. **Sidebar updates** — Treasury icon changed from `Vault` to `Landmark` (taller, more recognizable bank icon). Playground label renamed to "MCP Playground".
2. **Address input debounce** — Treasury page address input no longer requires pressing Enter. Fires vault lookup on every keystroke with 400ms debounce. Clear button cancels pending debounce.
3. **Vault overview redesign** — Replaced stacked stat cards + donut chart with Uniswap-inspired 3-column stat bar: Principal (with Chainlink rate), Total Balance (with yield %), Available Yield (with % of principal). Clean horizontal layout matching Uniswap's TVL display style.

**~10:45 UTC** — L1 RPC fix. `lido_get_apr` was failing because `eth.llamarpc.com` returns Cloudflare 403. Petar provides Tenderly mainnet gateway URL. Added `L1_RPC_URL` env var to root `.env`, `packages/app/.env`, and Vercel. Redeployed — Lido APR now returns 2.447%.

**~11:00 UTC** — ENS forward resolution fix. `ens_resolve("merkle.base.eth")` returned wrong address (`0x232E...`) — the real mainnet owner, not our agent. Root cause: `ReverseRegistrar.setName()` only sets reverse records; forward lookup via `L2Resolver.addr()` returns mainnet data. Fix: `ens_resolve` now checks reverse records of all known agent addresses first, preferring our agents over mainnet forward resolution. Returns a note when forward and reverse disagree.

**~11:15 UTC** — Delegations page rework. The page was completely disconnected from the chain — used empty `useState` with no on-chain reads. Rewrote:
- `useDelegations` hook now calls `getSpenderConfig` for every known agent against the active address, polls every 5s
- Cards show real data: spender name, max/tx, daily cap, spent in window, yield-only access
- Table view with same data in tabular format
- "Authorize Spender" button restored with form reworked to match `treasury_authorize_spender` params (spender address, max per tx, daily cap)
- Form runs as dry-run preview from dashboard — actual authorizations via MCP tools

**~11:30 UTC** — Staking page rework. Both cards had issues:
1. **Staking Position** — was showing only raw wallet wstETH balance with hardcoded $2400 ETH price. Reworked to show total wstETH across wallet + vault, with breakdown: vault principal, accrued yield, wallet balance, and Chainlink exchange rate.
2. **Vault Health** — had a broken SVG ring chart (rendered as just "61" and "Caution") with made-up metrics (collateral ratio, utilization rate). Replaced with meaningful vault health indicators: principal protection status, yield accrued %, authorized spenders count, daily exposure (sum of spender daily caps vs available yield), and a risk summary.
3. **APR disclaimer** — added note below mainnet Lido APR clarifying the demo treasury uses simulated yield on a forked testnet, which may differ from the live mainnet rate.

**~12:00 UTC** — Yield simulation fix. Petar discovered that the per-vault `principalStETHValue` manipulation (used to simulate yield) gets diluted by new deposits — yield percentage approaches zero as more agents deposit. Fix: replaced with **oracle rate bump** approach. Setup script now deploys a mock Chainlink oracle with a 5% higher rate and etches it at the real feed address via `anvil_setCode`. All vaults see yield equally regardless of deposit timing. Redeployed Anvil fresh with clean state.

> **New treasury address:** `0xc5C3f787eC2C0dd35B244D8FEE6666011F590b9D` (changed because fresh fork redeploy). All .env files and Vercel updated.

**~12:15 UTC** — Connect prompt for disconnected state. Previously, when no agent or wallet was connected, the dashboard fell back to `DEMO_TREASURY_ADDRESS` and showed Hackaclaw's vault data — confusing for new visitors. Changed: treasury and staking pages now show a "Connect to View Vault / Position" empty state with Bot + Wallet icons. APR hero still visible on staking page since it's useful regardless. Data only appears after connecting as an agent or with a wallet.

---

## Technical Decisions (All)

1. **MCP over REST API** — Model Context Protocol is the standard for agent tool discovery. Any MCP-compatible agent can plug in with one command.
2. **wstETH yield tracking via Chainlink** — `yield = (currentRate - depositRate) * principal / currentRate`. Uses Chainlink wstETH/stETH oracle on Base, not direct Lido contract calls.
3. **Anvil on Fly.io (was Tenderly)** — Migrated from Tenderly Virtual TestNet (20-block limit) to self-hosted Anvil fork on Fly.io. Yield simulation via `anvil_setStorageAt`. Public endpoint: `https://agentgate-anvil.fly.dev/`
4. **Base L2** — Primary deployment target. Low gas, Lido wstETH available via canonical bridge, Basenames for identity.
5. **Hosted MCP server on Vercel** — Agents connect via `claude mcp add --transport http`. Private keys server-side, Bearer token auth. No keys on agent machines.
6. **dry_run on every write tool** — Safety first for autonomous agent operations.
7. **Connect-first UX** — No demo fallback. Treasury/staking pages show empty state until user connects as agent or wallet.
8. **Basenames over ENS** — Base-native naming service. Works on L2, registered via `ReverseRegistrar.setName()`.
9. **Coarse 3-phase roadmap** — Foundation → Dashboard Pages → MCP Playground. Minimal overhead for hackathon timeline.
10. **HTTP bridge pattern** — `/api/mcp/[tool]` routes wrap MCP tool handlers for frontend consumption. Direct viem reads for speed, bridge for playground tool calls.
11. **Uniswap-inspired rebrand** — Neutral backgrounds (#131313) + hot-pink primary (#FF37C7).

## Mar 21 — Day 4: Autonomous Trading Bounty, Agent Connect UI, Toast Improvements

### Viraz ↔ merkle (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6) — continued session

**~18:00 IST (12:30 UTC)** — Toast notifications moved from `bottom-right` to `top-center` for demo video visibility. Font size bumped to 14px, max width 420px.

> Commit: `a4fa3a0`

**~18:30 IST** — Autonomous Trading Agent bounty ($5K) implementation started. Viraz's strategy: agents with delegated yield allowance execute a "Yield Harvest & Lend" recipe — withdraw yield → swap wstETH to USDC → supply USDC to Aave V3 → earn lending interest → withdraw → transfer profit back → depositor re-deposits (compounding).

Created `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/trading.ts` with 5 new MCP tools:
- `trading_list_recipes` — lists available autonomous trading strategies
- `aave_supply` — approve + supply USDC to Aave V3 Pool on Base (`0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5`)
- `aave_withdraw` — withdraw USDC + accrued interest from Aave V3
- `aave_position` — check aUSDC balance, collateral, debt, health factor
- `transfer_token` — transfer ERC-20 tokens (USDC, wstETH, or any address) with dynamic token resolution

Key addresses: Aave Pool `0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5`, aUSDC `0x4e65fE4DbA92790696d040ac24Aa414708F5c0AB`, USDC `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`.

Registered `registerTradingTools(server, ctx)` in `hosted.ts`. Also exported `getRegisteredAgentIds()` and `resolveAgentInfo()` from hosted.ts for the agent connect UI.

**~19:00 IST** — "Connect Agent" button built. Replaces the "Demo Mode" text in the top banner.

Architecture:
- `/api/agents` route — calls `getRegisteredAgentIds()` from MCP server, returns all registered agents with their derived addresses. Dynamic — any new agent added to `AGENT_KEY_MAP` appears automatically.
- `AgentWalletConnect` component — RainbowKit-styled button (same font family, colors, border radius). Disconnected state shows pink "Connect Agent" button. Connected state shows dark pill with basename + USDC balance + dropdown.
- USDC balance displayed next to agent name, polls every 5s via `useReadContract`. Updates live during swaps/transfers.
- Selection persisted in `localStorage` — auto-reconnects on page reload.
- Dropdown allows switching between agents or disconnecting.

**~19:30 IST** — Toast notifications now resolve all addresses to Base names. Created `use-basename-map.ts` hook — batch-resolves all known agent addresses via `useReadContracts` multicall (2 calls: `ReverseRegistrar.node()` + `L2Resolver.name()` for each address). Returns a synchronous lookup function used inside event callbacks where React hooks can't be called.

All toast events now show `hackaclaw.base.eth` / `merkle.base.eth` instead of `0x7703...36b9`.

**~19:45 IST** — Aave V3 toast notifications added. Watches aUSDC Transfer events:
- Mint from `0x0` → agent = "Aave: USDC Supplied" toast
- Burn from agent → `0x0` = "Aave: USDC Withdrawn" toast

Added `BASE_aUSDC` and `AAVE_POOL` to `addresses.ts`.

**~20:00 IST** — Delegations tab overhauled:
1. **Bidirectional delegation view** — hook now queries `getSpenderConfig` for all agent pairs where the connected address is involved (as depositor OR spender). Previously only showed delegations where connected address was the depositor.
2. **Direction badges** — blue "Granted" (I gave access) vs purple "Received" (I was given access)
3. **Counterparty display** — shows spender if you granted, owner if you received. All addresses resolve to basenames via existing `AddressDisplay` component.
4. **Deduplication** — `seen` set prevents duplicate queries for the same owner-spender pair.

**Commits pushed to main:**
- `0e55e1b` — feat(mcp): add Aave V3 trading tools and recipes for autonomous trading bounty
- `a9c6dc4` — feat(ui): add Connect Agent button with dynamic agent list and basename resolution
- `21e1f9b` — feat(ui): resolve toast notification addresses to basenames
- `e424ce8` — feat(ui): add Aave V3 toast notifications for supply and withdraw events
- `8c83565` — feat(ui): resolve delegation addresses to basenames, show only relevant delegations

### Updated Demo Flow (16-step)

**Phase 1 — Identity & Setup**
1. Both agents → `who_am_i` — discover address + agent ID

**Phase 2 — Treasury (Hackaclaw)**
2. Hackaclaw → `treasury_status` — check vault state
3. Hackaclaw → `treasury_deposit` — deposit wstETH directly into vault

**Phase 3 — Delegation**
4. Hackaclaw → `delegation_grant` — grant Merkle spending allowance from vault yield
5. Merkle → `delegation_status` — verify allowance received

**Phase 4 — Yield Harvest & Autonomous Trading (Merkle)**
6. Merkle → `trading_list_recipes` — list available recipes ("Yield Harvest & Lend")
7. Merkle → `treasury_withdraw_yield_for` — withdraw accrued yield from Hackaclaw's vault
8. Merkle → `uniswap_swap` — swap wstETH → USDC
9. Merkle → `aave_supply` — deposit USDC into Aave V3 (earn lending interest)
10. Merkle → `aave_position` — check Aave position (USDC + accrued interest)
11. Merkle → `aave_withdraw` — withdraw USDC + profit from Aave
12. Merkle → `transfer_token` — send USDC profit back to Hackaclaw

**Phase 5 — Compounding (Hackaclaw)**
13. Hackaclaw → `uniswap_swap` — swap USDC → wstETH
14. Hackaclaw → `treasury_deposit` — re-deposit into vault (principal grows = compounding)

**Phase 6 — Monitoring & ENS**
15. Either agent → `ens_resolve` / `ens_reverse` — resolve basenames
16. Either agent → `monitor_portfolio` — check full portfolio overview

---

### Session 3 — Mar 21, 2026 (afternoon–evening IST)

**UI Polish & Vault Visibility**
- Renamed "Connect Agent" button to "View as Agent"
- Vault overview now always visible (defaults to demo treasury address) — both agents can see principal + total balance
- Non-depositors (e.g. Merkle) see "Your Available Yield" as 0; only the depositor sees real yield
- Removed address input from treasury page
- Renamed "Available Yield" to "Your Available Yield"
- Moved Vault Health card from staking page to treasury page
- Replaced all "vault owner" language with "vault position" / "depositor" across contract, docs, hooks, and schemas
- Removed bounty prize amounts from README
- Deleted DEMO_SCRIPT.md

**Notification Filtering**
- Toast notifications now only show events involving the connected agent (deposits, delegations, swaps, Aave actions relevant to the viewer)

**Uniswap Swap Fix**
- Forced CLASSIC routing (UniswapX doesn't work on Anvil forks — no fillers)
- Added direct `Permit2.approve()` to set Universal Router allowance on-chain (bypasses permit signature which fails on forks due to timestamp mismatch)
- Removed permit signing from swap flow entirely — the direct approval handles authorization

**Autonomous Trading Page**
- New `/trading` route with "Autonomous Trading" sidebar tab
- Always shows "Available Recipes" section with "Yield Harvest & Lend" strategy steps
- "Your Open Positions" section appears only when agent has an active Aave V3 position (aUSDC > 0)
- Position card shows supplied aUSDC, collateral, debt, and health factor
- Removed Aave position from treasury page

**Staking Position Fix**
- Non-depositors (Merkle) now only see their own wallet wstETH balance, not the shared vault data

**APY Display**
- Total Balance now shows overall APY (calculated from real vault yield) for all viewers, not 0 for non-depositors

---

## Mar 21 — Day 4: wallet_balance Tool, Anvil Fork Reset, Demo Prep

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6) — continued

**~13:30 UTC** — Petar checks treasury vault status and deposits 0.01 wstETH. Both operations succeed. Then authorizes `merkle.base.eth` as yield spender with 0.001 wstETH per-tx cap and 0.005 daily cap. ENS resolved, spender authorized on-chain.

**~13:40 UTC** — Petar asks to swap all USDC to wstETH on Uniswap. Problem: no MCP tool exists to check ERC-20 token balances. The dashboard shows USDC balance (via wagmi `useReadContract`), but agents have no equivalent tool.

**~13:45 UTC** — Added `wallet_balance` tool to `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/monitor.ts`. Checks native ETH + 6 known ERC-20s on Base (USDC, wstETH, WETH, DAI, USDT, aUSDC). Supports optional `token` filter for single-token queries. Also fixed pre-existing build errors: missing `.js` extensions in `hosted.ts` imports (reverted — Next.js bundles `.ts` directly) and missing `PrivateKeyAccount` import in `index.ts`.

> Commit: `56dfdfd` — pushed to main, Vercel auto-deployed via GitHub Actions.

**~14:00 UTC** — Demo reset requested. Anvil fork on Fly.io needed a clean slate — all test deposits, spender authorizations, and yield simulations had to be wiped.

**~14:05 UTC** — First attempt: `fly machine restart` — failed because Anvil uses `--state /data/anvil-state.json` on a persistent Fly volume. Restart just reloads the saved state.

**~14:10 UTC** — Second attempt: stop machine, `rm /data/anvil-state.json`, start machine — failed because Anvil wrote new state from memory before shutdown, racing with the delete.

**~14:15 UTC** — Third attempt (successful): destroyed the machine entirely (`fly machine destroy --force`), destroyed the volume (`fly volumes destroy`), created a fresh volume (`fly volumes create anvil_data --region ams --size 1`), and redeployed (`fly deploy` from `infra/anvil/`). Verified: treasury contract no longer exists on fresh fork (confirmed via `eth_getCode`).

**~14:20 UTC** — Ran `anvil-demo-setup.sh` on fresh fork. `forge script` deploy step failed silently (output parsing issue in bash), but manual `forge script` succeeded. Ran remaining steps manually: approve + deposit 0.05 wstETH, deploy mock Chainlink oracle with 5% rate bump, register basenames. Treasury deployed at `0xFd027999609d95Ca3Db8B9F78f388816c3c7A380`.

> **Treasury address changed** from `0xc5C3f787eC2C0dd35B244D8FEE6666011F590b9D` to `0xFd027999609d95Ca3Db8B9F78f388816c3c7A380` (deterministic deploy from fresh nonce).

**~14:25 UTC** — Updated treasury address in all `.env` files (root + `packages/app/`). Updated Vercel env vars (`TREASURY_ADDRESS` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS`). `.env` files are gitignored, so pushed env changes to Vercel directly.

**~14:30 UTC** — Production deployment issue. Ran `vercel --prod` from CLI to update env vars, which accidentally overwrote the latest GitHub Actions deploy (missing Voraz's autonomous trading page commits). Fixed by re-triggering the latest GitHub Actions workflow (`gh run rerun`). Production now has all of Voraz's changes + correct treasury address.

**~14:35 UTC** — Dashboard confirmed working with fresh fork state: vault loads correctly with 0.05 wstETH principal, ~5% simulated yield.

**Vault state after reset:**
- Principal: 0.05 wstETH
- Available yield: ~0.00238 wstETH (simulated via oracle rate bump)
- Yield %: ~4.76%
- Basenames registered: hackaclaw.base.eth, merkle.base.eth
- Both agents funded with 100 ETH

## Session 4 — Mar 21, 2026 (evening IST)

### Viraz ↔ merkle (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6)

**Submission Prep & Documentation**

- Created root-level `AGENTS.md` for agentic judges — documents system capabilities, all 33 MCP tools, agent architecture, on-chain contract addresses, demo flow, and project structure
- Removed `packages/app/CLAUDE.md` and `packages/app/AGENTS.md` (Next.js boilerplate, not project-relevant)
- Fixed stale "16-step" reference in README Open Track bounty section → "18-step"
- Added **MetaMask — Best Use of Delegations** bounty target to README — 5 delegation MCP tools using MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit (ERC-7710/ERC-4337) with scoped caveat enforcers
- Reviewed Synthesis submission checklist (`https://synthesis.md/submission/skill.md`) and mapped remaining tasks

---

## Mar 21 — Day 4: Demo Recording, Doc Updates, Submission Prep

### Petar ↔ Hackaclaw (Claude Code, Claude Opus 4.6) — continued

**~14:45 UTC** — Production deployment fix. `vercel --prod` CLI deploy had overwritten the latest GitHub Actions deploy, missing Voraz's autonomous trading page. Fixed by re-triggering the latest GitHub Actions workflow (`gh run rerun`). Production confirmed working with all changes.

**~15:00 UTC** — Demo recording session. Petar and Viraz attempted StreamYard recording. Audio issue: Viraz's mic worked in the recording but Petar couldn't hear him live during the session (StreamYard monitoring issue, not a mic problem).

**~15:15 UTC** — Documentation updates across three files:
1. **DEMO.md** — Complete rewrite: replaced Tenderly references with Anvil on Fly.io, updated RPC URL to `agentgate-anvil.fly.dev`, expanded demo flow from 8 to 18 steps matching the full autonomous trading recipe, added fork reset instructions.
2. **README.md** — Added "Live Demo" link to `agent-gate-three.vercel.app/treasury` at top, updated tool count from 33 to 34 (added `wallet_balance`), updated "Why a Fork" section to describe Anvil migration from Tenderly, added "Base —" prefix to Autonomous Trading Agent bounty section.
3. **BOUNTIES-TODO.md** — Removed Status Network bounty (not pursued), added Base Autonomous Trading Agent bounty (all items checked), marked demo video as done, updated swap status as working on fork.

**~15:30 UTC** — Security review. Bearer tokens (`hackaclaw`, `merkle`) were visible in DEMO.md and README.md connect commands. Redacted to `<your-agent-id>` placeholders since the repo will be public and anyone could connect as those agents via the MCP server.

**~15:35 UTC** — Self-custody transfer complete for both agents. Merkle's self-custody transfer confirmed done by Viraz. Updated BOUNTIES-TODO.md.

---

## Session 5 — Mar 21, 2026 (late evening IST)

### Petar ↔ Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)

**Third-Party Agent Self-Registration**

**~18:00 UTC** — Started implementing dynamic agent registration. Initial approach stored server-generated private keys in Upstash Redis — rejected as fundamentally wrong. Third-party agents already have their own wallets; the server should never touch private keys.

**~18:30 UTC** — Research phase. Spawned researcher agent to investigate how MCP servers handle multi-agent access without custodial key storage. Key finding: **unsigned transaction pattern** is the industry standard — server prepares calldata via `encodeFunctionData`, returns `{to, data, value, chainId}`, agent signs externally. Multiple sources confirm (Google Cloud MCP blog, mcp-blockchain-server, viemcp).

**~19:00 UTC** — Implemented dual-mode architecture on `feature/agent-registration` branch:
- **First-party agents** (hackaclaw, merkle): server signs with env var keys (unchanged)
- **Third-party agents**: register with wallet address + signature proof (EIP-191), get API key, write tools return unsigned transactions
- Created `AgentRegistry` with Upstash Redis persistence — stores only `{address, name, type, createdAt}`, never private keys
- Created `executeOrPrepare` helper — each write tool auto-detects agent type and either signs+submits or returns unsigned tx
- Refactored all 13 write tools across treasury, trading, delegation, and uniswap modules
- Added `register_challenge` + `register_agent` MCP tools (two-step challenge-response)
- Added `submit_tx_hash` tool for receipt verification after external signing
- Added `POST /api/agents/register` REST endpoint

**~19:30 UTC** — Added address ownership verification via challenge-response flow:
1. Agent requests challenge → server returns message with nonce (5-min expiry)
2. Agent signs message locally with their private key (key never leaves their machine)
3. Agent submits signature → server verifies via `viem.verifyMessage()` → issues API key (hashed with SHA-256 before storage)

**~19:45 UTC** — Agent onboarding system:
- Created `agentgate.skill.md` — full agent-facing documentation (registration flow, MCP config, tool reference, unsigned tx workflow)
- Served at `/skill.md` for public access (Moltbook-style: "Read https://agent-gate-three.vercel.app/skill.md and follow the instructions")
- Created `scripts/register-agent.sh` — operator setup script using `cast wallet sign --interactive` (key never in shell history)
- Added CTA banner in dashboard: "AI Agent? Register to access DeFi tools"
- Added "Register your agent" link in View as Agent dropdown

**~20:00 UTC** — Dashboard UI improvements:
- Agent dropdown now polls `/api/agents` every 10 seconds (new registrations appear without page refresh)
- Search box appears when >5 agents registered
- Max-height scroll for large agent lists
- Fixed crash in `use-delegations.ts` when viewing dynamically registered agents not in hardcoded `AGENT_ADDRESSES`

**~20:15 UTC** — Tested third-party registration end-to-end. Spawned a fresh Claude Code session as a "burner agent" — it called the REST API, got a challenge, signed it, registered successfully, and received an API key + 1 ETH auto-funding on the Anvil fork.

**~20:30 UTC** — Merged `feature/agent-registration` into `main`. Created `backup/main` branch first as safety net. Triggered Vercel deploy.

**Uniswap Swap Fix — Fork-Aware Routing**

**~20:45 UTC** — Discovered Uniswap swap failures on fork. Two errors:
- ETH → wstETH: "LS" (no liquidity in 0.01% fee pool on fork)
- USDC → wstETH: `V3TooLittleReceived` (Uniswap API quotes against mainnet state but swap executes against fork's stale pool state)
- ETH → USDC worked because that pool has deep liquidity even when stale

**~21:00 UTC** — Diagnosed root cause by querying QuoterV2 contract directly on fork. Found that the 0.01% ETH/wstETH pool (which the API routes through) has zero liquidity on the fork, while the 0.05% pool works fine with ~0.29 wstETH output for 1 ETH.

**~21:15 UTC** — Implemented fork-aware swap using dual routing:
- **On Anvil fork**: Detects fork via `anvil_nodeInfo` RPC. Quotes directly against fork's QuoterV2 contract, tries all 4 fee tiers (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%), picks the best. Builds Universal Router calldata locally with fork-accurate minimum output.
- **On Base mainnet**: Uses Uniswap Trading API for routing and swap execution (unchanged)
- Also syncs Anvil timestamp to real-world time before swap (prevents deadline errors)

## Session 6 — Bug Fix & Vault Operations (Mar 21, 2026 ~21:00 UTC)

**Vault Status Check** — Checked vault health via `treasury_status`. Vault held 0.5076 wstETH principal with 0.00138 wstETH yield accrued (0.27%).

**Swap Path Padding Bug Fix**

**~21:00 UTC** — Attempted to swap 1000 USDC → wstETH but hit `Invalid count value: -22` error. Root cause: the Universal Router calldata builder tried to right-pad the V3 swap path (43 bytes = tokenIn + fee + tokenOut) into a single 32-byte ABI slot. The calculation `64 - (path.length - 2)` produced -22 since the path exceeds 32 bytes.

**Fix**: Changed both padding expressions (native and ERC20 paths) to use modular arithmetic: `(64 - ((path.length - 2) % 64)) % 64`, which correctly pads to the next 32-byte boundary regardless of path length. Committed and pushed to trigger Vercel redeploy.

**Swap & Deposit**

**~21:10 UTC** — After redeploy, successfully swapped 1000 USDC → 0.01766 wstETH via Uniswap (0.05% fee tier), then deposited 0.01766 wstETH into the AgentTreasury vault. New vault principal: ~0.525 wstETH.

**Files modified:**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/uniswap.ts` — Fixed swap path padding (lines 186, 208)

---

## Session 7 — Faucet for Human Wallets (Mar 21, 2026 ~22:00 UTC)

**Problem** — Agents get 1 ETH automatically upon registration, but human users who connect their wallets via RainbowKit have no way to get test ETH on the Anvil fork.

**Solution** — Built a signature-protected faucet: one-click "Request 1 test ETH" button in the dashboard header.

**Security discussion** — Initial implementation was a simple POST endpoint, but Petar flagged that anyone could curl it with arbitrary addresses. Added wallet signature verification: the frontend uses wagmi's `useSignMessage` to sign a fixed message (`"I am requesting 1 test ETH from the AgentGate faucet"`), and the API verifies the signature matches the claimed address via viem's `verifyMessage`. Each address can only claim once (tracked in Upstash Redis with `faucet:{address}` keys).

**Network visibility** — Petar raised that users can't see their balance in MetaMask since the Anvil fork isn't in their wallet's network list. Solution: the `FaucetButton` component uses wagmi's `useBalance` hook to read the balance directly from the Anvil RPC and displays it inline in the top bar (e.g., `1.0000 ETH`). No need to add a custom network — the dashboard shows everything.

**Flow:**
1. User connects wallet via RainbowKit (auto-pointed at Anvil via `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`)
2. Clicks "Request 1 test ETH" — wallet prompts signature
3. Signature + address sent to `POST /api/faucet`
4. Server verifies signature, checks Redis for prior claims
5. Reads current balance, adds 1 ETH via `anvil_setBalance`, marks claimed
6. Balance shown inline next to the faucet button

**Files added:**
- `packages/app/src/app/api/faucet/route.ts` — Faucet API endpoint with signature verification + Redis dedup
- `packages/app/src/components/faucet-button.tsx` — Faucet button with balance display, signature flow, state management

**Files modified:**
- `packages/app/src/components/demo-banner.tsx` — Integrated FaucetButton next to ConnectButton
- `.env.example` — Updated treasury addresses

---

## Session 8 — Dashboard Write Transactions for Human Wallets (Mar 21, 2026 ~23:00 UTC)

**Bug** — When a human user connected their wallet and tried to deposit wstETH or withdraw yield from the treasury page, the operation always ran as dry_run even with the "Simulate first" toggle off.

**Root cause** — Two layers both forced dry_run:
1. `bridge.ts:createBridgeContext` hardcoded `dryRun: true` ("Dashboard bridge is always read-only")
2. All treasury write tools in the bridge were `dryRunStub` — they just echoed params back with `mode: "dry_run"` regardless

The bridge was originally designed as read-only since the server has no wallet to sign with. But for connected human users, the wallet is in the browser — the bridge just needs to return unsigned transaction calldata and let the frontend sign via wagmi.

**Fix — three layers, zero MCP tool changes:**

1. **`bridge.ts`** — `createBridgeContext` now accepts a `dryRun` param (defaults `true` for backwards compat). Replaced 7 treasury `dryRunStub` entries with real handlers that use `encodeFunctionData` to produce calldata when `dryRun` is false. Added `unsignedTx()` helper. Delegation stubs left as-is.

2. **`/api/mcp/[tool]/route.ts`** — Passes `body.dry_run` through to bridge context. Defaults to `true` unless explicitly `false`.

3. **`use-mcp-action.ts`** — When bridge returns `mode: "unsigned_transaction"`, the hook submits each tx via wagmi's imperative `sendTransaction()`, waits for receipts, and returns `mode: "executed"` with tx hash. User rejection handled gracefully.

**What was NOT changed** (to protect agent flows):
- MCP tool implementations (`tools/treasury.ts`, `tools/trading.ts`, etc.)
- `execute-or-prepare.ts` (first-party/third-party agent execution)
- Agent registration, hosted MCP server, challenge-response auth
- Demo mode still forces dry-run via `isDemo` check in the hook

**Files modified:**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/bridge.ts` — Dynamic dryRun, real treasury write handlers with calldata encoding
- `packages/app/src/app/api/mcp/[tool]/route.ts` — Pass dry_run to bridge context
- `packages/app/src/lib/hooks/use-mcp-action.ts` — Handle unsigned_transaction → wallet sign → executed

---

## Session 9 — ETH → wstETH Swap Card for Human Wallets (Mar 21, 2026 ~23:30 UTC)

**Problem** — Human users who claim test ETH from the faucet have no easy way to swap it to wstETH for depositing into the treasury. The existing Uniswap swap tool is only available to agents via MCP.

**Approach** — Built a focused "Swap ETH → wstETH" card on the treasury page rather than a general swap UI. This covers the primary flow: faucet → swap → deposit. Created a dedicated `/api/swap` endpoint instead of routing through the bridge, to avoid duplicating 200+ lines of Uniswap routing logic.

**Implementation:**

1. **`/api/swap` endpoint** — Accepts `?action=quote` (returns expected wstETH output via QuoterV2 across all fee tiers) or `?action=execute` (syncs fork timestamp, finds best pool, builds Universal Router calldata with WRAP_ETH + V3_SWAP_EXACT_IN commands, returns unsigned transaction). Same swap mechanics as the MCP tool but purpose-built for ETH → wstETH.

2. **`SwapEthCard` component** — Live quote as user types amount (debounced 400ms), shows pool fee tier and slippage. On submit, calls execute endpoint, signs via wagmi `sendTransaction`, waits for receipt. Success state shows tx hash with "Swap again" reset. Only renders when wallet is connected. Handles user rejection gracefully.

3. **Treasury page layout** — Reorganized grid: SwapEthCard + DepositForm side by side (natural left-to-right flow: swap first, then deposit), WithdrawForm below.

**What was NOT changed:**
- MCP Uniswap tools (`tools/uniswap.ts`) — untouched
- Bridge tool registry — no swap handlers added
- Agent flows, registration, hosted MCP server — untouched

**Files added:**
- `packages/app/src/app/api/swap/route.ts` — Swap quote + execute endpoint with QuoterV2 + Universal Router
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/swap-eth-card.tsx` — Focused ETH → wstETH swap UI

**Files modified:**
- `packages/app/src/app/treasury/page.tsx` — Added SwapEthCard, reorganized grid layout

---

## Session 10 — UI Polish & Anvil Impersonation Fix (Mar 22, 2026 ~00:30 UTC)

**Card alignment & simulate toggle** — Removed arrow icon from swap card, added "Simulate first" toggle to match deposit/withdraw cards. All three cards use `flex + mt-auto` to bottom-align the toggle/button row. Swap card always renders (disabled when no wallet) instead of returning null. Updated demo mode text to match other cards. Treasury page grid changed to `lg:grid-cols-3` for all three cards in one row.

**MetaMask RPC mismatch fix** — When a human user tried to swap, MetaMask showed "Insufficient funds" and couldn't estimate gas. Root cause: MetaMask uses its own RPC for Base (chain 8453), not the Anvil fork, so it checks balances on real Base mainnet where the user has no ETH.

**Solution: Anvil impersonation** — All human wallet write operations (swap, deposit, withdraw, authorize, etc.) now execute server-side via `anvil_impersonateAccount`. The API impersonates the user's address on the fork, sends the transaction directly, and returns the tx hash. No MetaMask popup needed, no RPC mismatch. The `use-mcp-action` hook was simplified — removed all `sendTransaction`/wagmi signing logic since the bridge now returns executed results directly. MCP agent flows remain completely untouched.

**Wallet persistence** — Added `cookieStorage` to wagmi config so wallet connection survives page refreshes. Cookie is passed from server layout to client `Web3Provider` which calls `cookieToInitialState`. Hit a server/client boundary error (importing `getDefaultConfig` on server) — fixed by passing raw cookie string to the client component instead of importing wagmi config in the layout.

**Balance display** — ETH balance in header now polls every 5s (was one-shot). Added wstETH balance next to ETH: `0.5000 ETH · 0.2920 wstETH`. Uses `useReadContract` on the wstETH ERC-20 contract with 5s polling. Hidden when wstETH is zero.

**Files modified:**
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/swap-eth-card.tsx` — Remove arrow, add simulate toggle, always render, impersonation flow
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/deposit-form.tsx` — Flex + mt-auto alignment
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/withdraw-form.tsx` — Flex + mt-auto alignment
- `packages/app/src/app/treasury/page.tsx` — 3-column grid
- `packages/app/src/app/api/swap/route.ts` — Server-side execution via anvil_impersonateAccount
- `packages/mcp-server/src/bridge.ts` — impersonateAndSend helper, all treasury writes use it
- `packages/app/src/lib/hooks/use-mcp-action.ts` — Simplified, removed wallet signing
- `packages/app/src/lib/wagmi-config.ts` — Added cookieStorage
- `packages/app/src/providers/web3-provider.tsx` — Accept cookie prop, cookieToInitialState
- `packages/app/src/app/layout.tsx` — Pass cookie to Web3Provider
- `packages/app/src/components/faucet-button.tsx` — 5s polling, wstETH balance display

---

## Session 11 — Treasury Bug Fixes & UX Improvements (Mar 22, 2026 ~01:30 UTC)

**Bridge ABI missing write functions** — Deposit from the dashboard failed with `Function "deposit" not found on ABI`. The bridge's inline `TREASURY_ABI` only had read functions (`getVaultStatus`, `getCurrentRate`, etc.) since it was originally built as read-only. Added all 7 write function signatures (`deposit`, `withdrawYield`, `withdrawYieldFor`, `authorizeSpender`, `revokeSpender`, `setRecipientWhitelist`, `setAllowedRecipient`).

**ERC-20 approval before deposit** — Deposit reverted on-chain because the treasury contract requires `wstETH.approve(treasury, amount)` before calling `deposit()`. Added an `approve(treasury, maxUint256)` impersonation call before the deposit transaction in the bridge's `treasuryDeposit` handler.

**DryRunResult component** — Was showing "Simulation passed" for executed transactions (including reverts). Updated to distinguish `mode: "executed"` vs `mode: "dry_run"` — now shows "Transaction confirmed" (green) or "Transaction reverted" (red) for executed results.

**Vault overview showing hackaclaw's data when disconnected** — `useVaultStatus` was hardcoded to query `DEMO_TREASURY_ADDRESS`. Changed to use `activeAddress` from app context. Added `enabled: !isDemo` to disable vault and delegation queries in demo mode. Removed `keepPreviousData` from both hooks so data clears on disconnect instead of showing stale results. Updated labels to "Your Principal", "Your Total Balance", "Your Available Yield".

**Discussion: aggregate vs per-user vault data** — Viraz (sleeping, India timezone) wants the vault overview to show total contract-level data. The contract's `getVaultStatus(agent)` is per-agent only with no aggregate getter. Could read `wstETH.balanceOf(treasury)` for total balance but can't split principal vs yield without a contract change. Decision: keep per-user for now with "Your" labels, revisit with Viraz.

**Withdraw card — available yield display** — Added "Available: X.XXXX wstETH" next to the amount label. Button disables when amount exceeds available yield with error: "Exceeds available yield. Only accrued yield can be withdrawn — principal is locked."

**Deposit card — wallet balance display** — Added "Balance: X.XXXX wstETH" next to the amount label. Reads wstETH balance via `useReadContract` with 5s polling. Button disables when amount exceeds wallet balance.

**Files modified:**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/bridge.ts` — Added write functions to ABI, wstETH approve before deposit
- `packages/app/src/components/shared/dry-run-result.tsx` — Distinguish executed vs dry_run results
- `packages/app/src/lib/hooks/use-treasury.ts` — Use activeAddress, disable in demo mode
- `packages/app/src/lib/hooks/use-delegations.ts` — Disable in demo mode, remove keepPreviousData
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/vault-overview.tsx` — "Your" labels, skip basename in demo
- `packages/app/src/components/staking/position-card.tsx` — Fixed isDepositor logic
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/withdraw-form.tsx` — Show available yield, prevent over-withdrawal
- `packages/app/src/components/treasury/deposit-form.tsx` — Show wstETH balance, prevent over-deposit

## Session 12 — Phase 05: Activity Foundation (Mar 22, 2026 ~12:00 UTC)

**Goal:** Build the activity logging infrastructure in `packages/mcp-server` — the data layer that all live agent monitoring depends on.

**Plan 05-01 (Wave 1): ActivityLog Module with TDD** — Created the foundation data layer using TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR). Built `ActivityEvent` interface (id, agentId, agentAddress, toolName, params, result, status, timestamp, durationMs, tx fields), `CircularBuffer<T>` ring buffer (500 capacity, drops oldest on overflow), and `ActivityLog` class with two-phase event lifecycle (pending → success/error), listener pub/sub with unsubscribe, BigInt-safe param serialization, and `globalThis` singleton pattern to survive module re-evaluation. Added vitest to mcp-server package. 20 unit tests all passing.

**Plan 05-02 (Wave 2): MCP Server Instrumentation** — Connected the ActivityLog to the real MCP execution flow. Added `wrapServerWithLogging()` function in `hosted.ts` that intercepts every `server.tool()` callback — captures agent identity, tool name, params, then completes with result/timing. Threads `activeEventId` through `AgentGateContext` so `executeOrPrepare` can enrich events with on-chain transaction data (txHash, txStatus, blockNumber). Both `executeOrPrepare` and `executeOrPrepareMany` enrichment implemented. Bridge/playground paths intentionally untouched — only hosted (agent) tool calls produce events. 6 integration tests added (26 total passing).

**Verification gap fix** — Verifier caught 7 TypeScript errors in the test file: missing `.js` import extension and implicit `any` types on callback params. Fixed inline — all 26 tests pass, `tsc --noEmit` clean for phase 05 files.

**Key design decisions:**
- `CircularBuffer` with fixed 500 capacity — keeps memory bounded, no persistence needed for demo
- `globalThis.__agentgate_activity_log__` singleton — survives HMR/re-evaluation in dev
- `wrapServerWithLogging` patches `server.tool` before any tool registration — zero changes to individual tool handlers
- `enrichEvent` is separate from `completeEvent` — tx data arrives after tool callback returns, doesn't re-trigger listeners
- Bridge calls produce NO events — only hosted MCP server (agent) calls are tracked

**Files created:**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/activity-log.ts` — ActivityEvent, CircularBuffer, ActivityLog, globalThis singleton
- `packages/mcp-server/src/activity-log.test.ts` — 26 tests (unit + integration)
- `packages/mcp-server/vitest.config.ts` — Vitest config for mcp-server package

**Files modified:**
- `packages/mcp-server/package.json` — Added vitest devDependency + test script
- `packages/mcp-server/src/context.ts` — Added `activeEventId?: number` to AgentGateContext
- `packages/mcp-server/src/hosted.ts` — Added `wrapServerWithLogging`, integrated into `createMcpServer`
- `packages/mcp-server/src/execute-or-prepare.ts` — Added tx enrichment in both executeOrPrepare and executeOrPrepareMany

---

## Session 13 — Contract Redeploy, Fork Reset & Pool Rebalancing Discussion (Mar 22, 2026 ~16:00 UTC)

**Contract redeploy with aggregate functions** — Discovered the previous deploy (session 6) was compiled from `feat/live-agent-dashboard` branch which lacked the `getTotalVaultStatus()`, `totalPrincipalWstETH`, and `depositorCount` additions from commit `101c4cb`. The `main` branch had the aggregate functions but the working branch didn't. Copied the contract source from `main`, but the Anvil fork's Uniswap pools were heavily drained from prior test swaps (1 ETH → 0.005 wstETH instead of ~0.77).

**Fork reset & full redeploy** — Reset the Anvil fork to get fresh pool liquidity. Re-ran full setup: synced timestamp, funded hackaclaw + merkle with 100 ETH each, deployed AgentTreasury (landed at deterministic address `0xFd027999609d95Ca3Db8B9F78f388816c3c7A380`), dealt 1 wstETH to hackaclaw, deposited 0.5 wstETH, deployed mock Chainlink oracle with 5% rate bump (1.2299 → 1.2914), registered basenames. Updated all env files (root `.env`, `packages/app/.env`) and Vercel env vars.

**Mock oracle approach** — The Anvil fork freezes the Chainlink wstETH/stETH rate at fork time. To simulate yield, we deploy a `MockFeed` contract that returns `block.timestamp` for `updatedAt` (so it never goes stale) and a bumped `answer`, then etch its bytecode at the real Chainlink feed address via `anvil_setCode` + `anvil_setStorageAt`. All vaults see yield equally — the rate is global, just like real Lido.

**Pool rebalancing discussion** — Uniswap pools on the fork degrade over time since no arbitrageurs rebalance them. Discussed approaches:
- Fork reset: wipes all user state, disruptive to testers — ruled out as routine solution
- Swap-based rebalancer bot: seed a reserve address with both sides of each pool, cron job checks price drift vs oracle, swaps to push price back. Clean and predictable.
- Direct `slot0` manipulation: set `sqrtPriceX96` storage directly. Simpler but fragile.
- Decision: will implement the swap-based rebalancer later.

**Key rule established:** Never reset the Anvil fork without explicit permission — other users may be actively testing.

**Funded external tester** — Gave 10 ETH to `0xE0fF737685fdE7Fd0933Fc280D53978b3d0700D5` via `anvil_setBalance`.

---

## Session 14 — Uniswap Pool Rebalancer (Mar 22, 2026 ~16:30 UTC)

**Problem** — Uniswap V3 pools on the Anvil fork degrade over time as test swaps consume liquidity without arbitrageurs rebalancing. After heavy testing, 1 ETH → 0.005 wstETH instead of ~0.77 wstETH.

**Solution** — Built a swap-based rebalancer that compares fork pool prices against live Base mainnet and corrects drift:

1. **Local script** (`scripts/rebalance-pools.ts`) — Standalone TypeScript script using viem. Supports one-shot (`npm run rebalance`) and continuous watch mode (`npm run rebalance:watch`). Uses a dedicated rebalancer address (`0x...dEaDbA1A`) seeded with 1000 ETH, 500 WETH, 500 wstETH, and 1M USDC via `anvil_setStorageAt`. Monitors 5 pairs (WETH↔wstETH, WETH↔USDC, USDC→wstETH). Swaps via `anvil_impersonateAccount` — no private key needed.

2. **Vercel cron function** (`/api/cron/rebalance`) — Same logic as an API route, triggered every 5 minutes via Vercel cron. Protected by `CRON_SECRET` header (auto-injected by Vercel). Returns JSON with per-pair drift percentages and rebalancing actions taken.

**How it works:**
- Queries QuoterV2 on both fork and mainnet with a small probe amount for each pair
- Calculates drift percentage: `(forkOut - mainnetOut) / mainnetOut * 100`
- If drift exceeds threshold (default 2%), swaps in the corrective direction
- Swap amount scales with drift severity (10x probe × drift factor, capped at 20x)
- Seeds rebalancer tokens before each run (idempotent — tops up if depleted)
- Post-rebalance check confirms pools are back within threshold

**Config:**
- `vercel.json` — Added `crons` array with `*/5 * * * *` schedule
- `CRON_SECRET` env var added to Vercel for auth

**Files added:**
- `scripts/rebalance-pools.ts` — Local rebalancer script
- `packages/app/src/app/api/cron/rebalance/route.ts` — Vercel cron endpoint

**Files modified:**
- `vercel.json` — Added cron schedule
- `package.json` — Added `rebalance` and `rebalance:watch` scripts

---

## Session 15 — Yield Tick Cron (Mar 22, 2026 ~17:00 UTC)

**Problem** — The mock Chainlink oracle on the Anvil fork returns a fixed rate, so vault yield never grows after the initial setup. Users can't test yield accrual or observe APY changes over time.

**Solution** — Added a Vercel cron function (`/api/cron/yield-tick`) that bumps the oracle rate every 5 minutes to simulate Lido staking yield.

**Rate math:** Real Lido is ~3.5% APY (invisible in a demo). We target ~100% APY for demo-friendly visibility. With 105,120 ticks/year (every 5 min), the per-tick bump is 6593 per billion: `newRate = currentRate * 1_000_006_593 / 1_000_000_000`. This compounds to ~100% APY.

**Tested directly against the fork** — manually ran 11 ticks, confirmed yield grew from 4.76% → 4.77% of principal. Oracle rate incremented correctly each tick.

**Pending: localhost timeout** — The `/api/cron/yield-tick` route connects on localhost:3000 but hangs (times out after 30s+). Needs debugging — likely an issue with RPC calls in the Next.js route handler. Deferred to next session.

**Files added:**
- `packages/app/src/app/api/cron/yield-tick/route.ts` — Yield tick cron endpoint

**Files modified:**
- `vercel.json` — Added second cron job for yield-tick

---

## Session 16 — Live Agent Dashboard: Phase 05 UAT (Mar 22, 2026 ~18:00 UTC)

**Context** — Milestone v1.1 (Live Agent Activity Dashboard) phase 05 was built in a previous session on the `feat/live-agent-dashboard` branch. This session ran user acceptance testing against the completed phase.

**Branch confusion** — Session started on `main` instead of `feat/live-agent-dashboard` (unclear how). Switched to the correct branch to access the phase 05 code. Discovered an uncommitted treasury layout fix (3-column grid for Swap/Deposit/Withdraw cards) had been auto-stashed during the branch switch — popped it back.

**Phase 05 UAT — all 6 tests passed:**

1. **Unit Tests Pass** — All 26 vitest tests pass (20 ActivityLog + 6 MCP instrumentation)
2. **ActivityLog Singleton** — `getActivityLog()` returns same instance (globalThis pattern verified in tests)
3. **CircularBuffer Cap** — Buffer overflow at 500 tested, oldest events dropped correctly
4. **MCP Tool Events** — `wrapServerWithLogging` creates pending→success/error events with agent identity
5. **Tx Enrichment** — `executeOrPrepare` enriches events with txHash/txStatus/blockNumber; bridge paths skip enrichment
6. **BigInt Safety** — BigInt params serialized without TypeError at ingestion time

**No issues found.** Phase 05 verified and ready for phase 06 (SSE route to stream events to dashboard).

**Stash recovery** — Treasury page layout (`lg:grid-cols-3` with all three cards in one row) was never committed — existed only as a working tree change. Recovered from `stash@{0}` and applied.

---

## Session 17 — Phase 06: Discuss Context (Mar 22, 2026 ~19:00 UTC)

**Goal:** Capture implementation decisions for Phase 06 (API and Real-Time Endpoints) before planning — the discuss-phase step of the GSD workflow.

**Prior context loaded:** PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, Phase 05 CONTEXT.md (activity logging decisions), codebase maps (ARCHITECTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md). Scouted existing code: `activity-log.ts` (Phase 05 output), existing `/api/agents` route, `/api/mcp-agent` route, and all API route patterns.

**Phase boundary:** Dashboard clients can fetch agent registry data, query activity history, and receive real-time event streams. Three endpoints: enhanced GET /api/agents, new GET /api/activity, new GET /api/activity/sse.

**Four gray areas identified and discussed:**

### Activity query API
- Full dump of all 500 events (no pagination — buffer is capped anyway)
- `?agent=<agentId>` filter only — no status or time-range filters
- Newest-first sort order (reverse chronological)
- Raw payloads — no field truncation or stripping

### SSE event stream
- Stream both pending (tool call started) AND completion (success/error) — enables real-time "working" indicators
- Last-Event-ID reconnection support — server replays missed events from buffer
- 30-second heartbeat comment to keep connections alive through proxies
- Stream all events (no per-agent filtering) — client-side filtering if needed
- Activity events only — no separate agent-status event type in the stream

### Agent status derivation
- Three states: **active** (has pending event), **idle** (has completed events, none pending), **registered** (in registry but zero activity ever)
- Status computed server-side in the /api/agents response — single source of truth
- Phase 8 infers status changes from SSE activity events

### Existing /api/agents enhancement
- Enhance existing route in-place (no new endpoint)
- Add `status` (active/idle/registered) and `lastActivityAt` timestamp fields
- Keep existing fields: name, address, type, registration date

**Output:** `.planning/phases/06-api-and-real-time-endpoints/06-CONTEXT.md` — committed as `docs(06): capture phase context`.

**Next step:** `/gsd:plan-phase 6` to create the implementation plan.

---

## Session 18 — Phase 06: API and Real-Time Endpoints Execution (Mar 22, 2026 ~19:30 UTC)

**Goal:** Execute Phase 06 — build REST API endpoints for agent data and SSE streaming for real-time activity updates. Two plans across two waves.

**Plan 06-01 (Wave 1): REST API Endpoints** — Three tasks executed with TDD:

1. **Activity-log subpath export** — Added `./activity-log` subpath export to `packages/mcp-server/package.json` so the Next.js app can import `getActivityLog()`. Added `createdAt` field to `listAgents()` in `registry.ts`.

2. **Enhanced GET /api/agents** — Added `deriveStatus()` function that computes agent status from activity log events:
   - `active` — has a pending (in-progress) event
   - `idle` — has completed events but none pending
   - `registered` — in registry but zero activity

   Response now includes `status`, `lastActivityAt`, and `createdAt` per agent. 5 tests.

3. **New GET /api/activity** — Returns all activity events from the circular buffer in newest-first order. Supports `?agent=<agentId>` query param for filtering. 4 tests.

**Plan 06-02 (Wave 2): SSE Streaming Endpoint** — Two tasks executed with TDD:

1. **GET /api/activity/sse** — ReadableStream-based SSE endpoint using `text/event-stream` content type. Subscribes to `ActivityLog.onEvent()` for live events. 30-second heartbeat interval (`: heartbeat\n\n`) to keep connections alive through proxies. Cleanup on `req.signal` abort (unsubscribe, clear interval, close stream). `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to prevent Next.js caching.

2. **Last-Event-ID reconnection** — Parses `Last-Event-ID` header on reconnect, replays missed events from the buffer (events with `id > lastId`), then subscribes for new events. 5 tests total covering headers, streaming, cleanup, reconnection, and force-dynamic export.

**Verification — 7/7 must-haves passed:**
- All three status derivation paths tested (active/idle/registered)
- Activity endpoint with newest-first ordering and agent filtering
- SSE streaming with live event delivery
- 30s heartbeat keepalive
- Disconnect cleanup (unsub + clearInterval + controller.close)
- Last-Event-ID replay with correct filtering
- Requirements INFRA-04, INFRA-05, INFRA-06 all satisfied

3 items flagged for human verification (runtime behaviors): live SSE delivery from real MCP calls, 30s heartbeat timing, and agent status transitions from actual activity.

- `packages/app/src/app/api/activity/sse/route.ts` — SSE streaming endpoint
- `packages/app/src/app/api/agents/route.test.ts` — 5 agent endpoint tests
- `packages/app/src/app/api/activity/route.test.ts` — 4 activity endpoint tests
- `packages/app/src/app/api/activity/sse/route.test.ts` — 5 SSE endpoint tests

**Key files modified:**
- `packages/mcp-server/package.json` — Added `./activity-log` subpath export
- `packages/mcp-server/src/registry.ts` — Added `createdAt` to `listAgents()`
- `packages/app/src/app/api/agents/route.ts` — Enhanced with `deriveStatus()`

**Test totals:** 14 new tests (app package), 26 existing (mcp-server) — all passing.

**Next step:** Phase 7 (Sprite Animation System) — pixel-art agent avatars with state-driven animations.

### Phase 06 UAT — merkle (Claude Code)

**~11:25 UTC** — Ran `/gsd:verify-work 6` to validate all Phase 06 endpoints against live server.

**Test results:** 5/5 passed — GET /api/agents (status derivation, createdAt), GET /api/activity (empty events array, correct), SSE stream (connects, heartbeat received at ~30s), SSE Last-Event-ID (unit-tested, stream verified).

**Blocker found & fixed during UAT:** Both `/api/activity` and `/api/activity/sse` routes hung indefinitely in Next.js dev mode — server accepted TCP connections but never responded. `next build` compiled fine in 14.7s, confirming it was a Turbopack dev-mode issue.

**Root cause:** `transpilePackages: ["@agentgate/mcp-server"]` in `next.config.ts` caused Turbopack to hang when compiling new routes. Next.js 16 Turbopack resolves monorepo `.ts` subpath exports natively — the setting was unnecessary and harmful.

**Fixes applied:**
1. Removed `transpilePackages` from `next.config.ts` — fixed Turbopack compilation hang
2. Removed 10s polling interval from `agent-wallet-connect.tsx` — was hitting `/api/agents` every 10s on every page, competing with route compilation and unnecessary now that SSE exists for real-time updates

**Commits:**
- `db50f25` — test(06): complete UAT - 5 passed, 0 issues

### Phase 07 Context Discussion — merkle (Claude Code)

**~12:00 UTC** — Ran `/gsd:discuss-phase 7` to capture implementation decisions for Phase 7: Sprite Animation System.

**Discussion covered 4 gray areas:**

1. **Character design** — Pixel robots (Cursouls-inspired). SVG sprite sheets with parameterized template — one base robot SVG with CSS variable slots for body color, visor style, antenna shape. Each agent gets a unique visual derived from their address hash. 32x32 pixel frames at 3x scale (~96px on screen), 4 frames × 3 animation rows (idle, walk, work).

2. **Scene movement** — Random wandering in a full-width top banner area (~250px tall) above agent cards and activity feed. Sprites pick random destinations, walk there via CSS transitions, pause 2-5s, repeat. Dark page background with subtle dot grid. Sprites face walking direction via CSS `scaleX(-1)` flip.

3. **State-animation mapping** — Direct mapping from Phase 6 agent status: `active` → working animation (stationary), `idle` → wander cycle, `registered` → idle only (no movement). AgentSprite component is prop-driven with demo default — Phase 7 works standalone, Phase 8 wires real SSE status. Frame rate: ~4 FPS (250ms/frame) for retro charm.

4. **Hover card behavior** — Floating card above sprite on hover, sprite pauses movement when hovered. Card shows name, truncated address, colored status dot (green/amber/gray), current action. Fade in/out animation. Uses existing Card/Tooltip styling.

**Key decision: SVG over PNG** — User chose SVG sprite sheets specifically to enable truly randomized, distinguishable characters without hand-drawn art per agent. Parameterized SVG template with address-hash-derived features.

**Deferred to v2:** Celebration animations (VIS-01), speech bubbles (VIS-02), scene environment (VIS-03).

**Output:** `.planning/phases/07-sprite-animation-system/07-CONTEXT.md`

**Commits:**
- `f6c3e8c` — docs(07): capture phase context
- `1c1c042` — docs(state): record phase 7 context session

**Next step:** `/gsd:plan-phase 7` — break down into executable plans.

### Session 12 — Phase 7 Execution: Sprite Animation System

**~13:00 UTC** — Ran `/gsd:execute-phase 7` to build the sprite animation system. 2 plans across 2 waves.

**Wave 1 — Plan 07-01: Sprite Foundation**
Built the core sprite infrastructure:
- `sprite-utils.ts` — 4 utility functions: `addressToSpriteColor` (deterministic hue from wallet address), `statusToAnimation`, `statusToColor`, `statusToActionText`
- `robot-svg.tsx` — Inline SVG pixel robot template with 12 frames (4 idle, 4 walk, 4 work)
- `sprite.css` — CSS keyframes using `steps(4)` for retro frame-by-frame animation
- `AgentSprite.tsx` — Interactive sprite component with hover detail card
- 24 tests (14 unit + 10 component)

**Wave 2 — Plan 07-02: Sprite Scene Container**
Built the scene and wandering system:
- `SpriteScene.tsx` — Full-width banner container (250px) with `ResizeObserver`, random wandering via CSS transitions, idle pause cycles (2-5s)
- Only idle agents wander; active agents stay stationary (work animation); registered agents stay stationary (idle animation)
- 7 additional tests

**Visual verification checkpoint** — Added SpriteScene temporarily to treasury page for live testing. Three user-requested refinements during checkpoint:

1. **Persistent name labels** — Added always-visible name + status dot below each sprite (not just on hover). User feedback: "hard to tell which agent is what without hovering."
2. **Font size tweak** — Changed from `text-[11px]` to `text-xs`, tightened gap and margin per user preference.
3. **Flip direction fix** — `scaleX(-1)` was on the outer wrapper, flipping name labels and hover cards mirror-style. Moved flip to sprite viewport only, added `facingLeft` prop to AgentSprite.

**Test fix** — Updated hover card test to use `getByTestId("hover-card")` instead of `queryByText("TestBot")` to avoid matching the new persistent label. All 31 sprite tests passing.

**Verification:** gaps_found (1 test gap) → fixed inline → all requirements covered (SPRITE-01 through SPRITE-04).

**Commits:**
